  I would appreciate comments from people, an acknowledgement
  in work that make use of the code and if possible, reprints,
  preprints of papers with applications.  I still think the code
  is somewhat more special than LINPACK etc, but I guess (hope)
  its a matter of timescale and frame of mind.
