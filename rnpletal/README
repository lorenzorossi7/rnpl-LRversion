Installation instructions:

1. Edit 'Install' script, and modify/enable environment variable
   settings ('CC', 'CFLAGS', etc.) as necessary to match your 
   desired compilation environment.  If you skip this step, the
   various 'configure' scripts included in this distribution will 
   use default values that will depend on your operating system. 

2. Execute the 'Install' script, supplying as the single argument
   the desired installation prefix, e.g.:

   % Install /usr/local

   Configure/install progress will be echoed to standard output, 
   as well as to the file 'Install.log'

   The following versions of 'Install', that have all of the 
   environment variables appropriately set are also currently 
   available:

      Install.Pathscale
      Install.gnu
      Install.gnu.FreeBSD
      Install.gnu.mpich
      Install.intel.AMD64
      Install.intel.P4
      Install.osf1
      Install.osx.gnu
      Install.pgi.AMD64
      Install.pgi.P4
      Install.pgi.PIII
      Install.sgi
      Install.sun
      Install.sun.gnu

Known problems:

1. Unless you have previously installed the 'xvs' package, the 
   executable 'seg2xvs' in the 'utilio' package will not build.
   Unless you *really* want to send .segdat files to 'xvs', 
   you can safely ignore the resulting error messages.
